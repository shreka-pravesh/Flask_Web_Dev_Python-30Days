Day 01 – Intro to Flask & Environment Setup  

What I Did  

- This is the first day of my Flask web development journey.  
- I set up Flask, created my first few routes, and learned how to display messages on a web page.

Programs learned

> hello_flask.py – My first Flask app that shows “Hello Flask \”  
> welcome_route.py – Added a new /welcome page  
> personal_greeting.py – Greets you by your name  
> multiple_pages.py – Small website with Home, About, and Contact pages  
> debug_example.py – Used debug mode for auto-reload  
> fun_quote.py – (Bonus) Shows a random quote each time you refresh  

What I Learned

* How Flask apps work
* How routes display pages
* How to pass values through URLs
* How to enable debug mode
* How to mix Python and web pages in a fun way
