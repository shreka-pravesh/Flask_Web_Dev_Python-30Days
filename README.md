FlaskWebPath — 30 Days of Flask Web Development

This repository captures my 30-day journey of learning Flask, exploring how web development really works — from setting up simple routes to building and deploying complete web applications.

Purpose

  - The main goal of this challenge is to understand web development from scratch using Flask.
  - Each day adds a new piece to the puzzle — routes, templates, forms, databases, APIs, and finally, a fully working project.

What’s Inside

  > Every folder represents one day’s progress and includes:
  > A practical and working Flask program
  > Well-structured, readable code
  > A short README explaining the concept and task

Learning Phases

Phase 1: Getting Started (Days 1–5)

  Learn the fundamentals of Flask and create your first interactive web pages.
  Topics: Setup, Routing, Templates, Static Files, Forms.

Phase 2: Core Flask Features (Days 6–10)

  Discover Flask’s key components that make apps dynamic and powerful.
  Topics: Request/Response Cycle, Sessions, Error Handling, Blueprints.

Phase 3: Working with Databases (Days 11–15)

  Connect your Flask app with a database and build a basic CRUD application.
  Topics: SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, Notes App.

Phase 4: REST APIs (Days 16–20)

  Learn to build secure and efficient RESTful APIs.
  Topics: Flask-RESTful, CRUD APIs, JWT Authentication, JSON Handling.

Phase 5: Advanced Features (Days 21–25)

  Bring your apps closer to real-world use cases with additional features.
  Topics: Flask-Mail, File Uploads, API Integrations, Admin Panels.

Phase 6: Final Projects (Days 26–30)

  Build and deploy complete Flask-based projects that combine everything learned.
  Topics: Blog App, Portfolio, Authentication, Deployment.
